### Young children's screen time: The complex role of parent and child factors

Alexis R. Lauricella, Ellen Wartella, Victoria J. Rideout (2015)

**Research Questions**

- H1: Is parent screen time positively associated with child screen time
  across television, computers, smartphones, and tablets?

- H2: Are parental attitudes about each technology's impact positively
  linked to child screen time?

- H3: Does child screen time differ by age (under 2, 2--5, 6--8) across
  all four platforms?

- RQ1: Do parent media use, parent attitudes, and child age interact to
  predict child screen time?

**  
Key Findings: Parental Smartphone Use & Child Development**

- **Parental smartphone time was strongly correlated with child
  smartphone use**, especially for children aged 2--8.

- Parents who used smartphones more heavily had children who spent
  **significantly more time** with smartphones.

- Positive **parental attitudes toward mobile devices** were associated
  with increased child use, particularly for older children (6--8
  years).

- **Under age 2**, the correlation between parental and child smartphone
  use was **not statistically significant**, possibly due to
  developmental limitations.

**Limitations**

- All screen‐time measures were self‐reported, introducing recall and
  social‐desirability bias.

- Cross‐sectional design prevents any causal inference between parent
  behavior and child use.

- The survey didn't capture co-use (e.g., parent--child joint media
  activities) or detailed content/context of screen interactions.

- Despite weighting, panel recruitment and nonresponse may limit full
  representativeness of U.S. parents.

### Parent and child problematic media use: The role of maternal postpartum depression and dysfunctional parent-child interactions in young children

**Hailey G. Holmgren**, Laura Stockdale, Megan Gale, Sarah M. Coyne  
**Published in 2022** in *Computers in Human Behavior*

**Research Questions**

- How do symptoms of **maternal postpartum depression (PPD)** influence:

  - Parent-child dysfunctional interactions

  - Parent and child problematic media use

  - Parental depression over time

- Does **parent-child dysfunctional interaction** mediate the
  relationship between maternal PPD and media use/depression?

**Summary of Data Collection and Methodology**

| **Aspect**                 | **Details**                                                                    |

| **Time Points**            | Time 1: PPD & interaction; Time 2: interaction; Time 3: media use & depression |
| **Retention Rate**         | 89% across three waves                                                         |

**Summary of Key Findings in the Context of Parental Smartphone Use &
Child Development**

- **Maternal PPD at Time 1** was significantly associated with:

  - Increased **parent-child dysfunctional interactions** at Time 2

  - Higher levels of **problematic media use** in both parents and
    children at Time 3

  - Elevated **parental depression** at Time 3

- **Dysfunctional interactions** mediated the link between PPD and
  **parental depression**, but **not** between PPD and media use.

- **Problematic media use** in children was linked to:

  - Emotional dysregulation

  - Difficulty disengaging from screens

  - Increased screen time as a coping mechanism

- **Parents with PPD** may use media (e.g., smartphones) for distraction
  or social support, which can evolve into **problematic use patterns**.

- These patterns can lead to **technoference**---media use interfering
  with bonding and interaction---potentially modeling unhealthy habits
  for children.

## Screen media exposure and behavioral adjustment in early childhood during and after COVID-19 home lockdown periods

**Noa Gueron-Sela**, Ido Shalev, Avigail Gordon-Hacker, Alisa Egotubov,
Rachel Barr  
**Published in 2023** in *Computers in Human Behavior*

**Research Questions**

1.  How did young children's screen media use change before, during, and
    after COVID-19 lockdowns?

2.  Are different aspects of screen media use during lockdowns related
    to children's post-lockdown behavioral adjustment?

3.  Do child characteristics (e.g. age, sex), developmental stage, and
    contextual factors (e.g. family income) moderate these associations?

**Summary of Data Collection and Methodology**

| **Aspect**                 | **Details**                                                                       |

**Summary of Key Findings in the Context of Parental Smartphone Use &
Child Development**

- 📱 **Parental mobile device use** during parenting routines (meals,
  playtime, bedtime) was associated with:

  - Increased **externalizing and internalizing behavior problems** in
    children post-lockdown

  - Disrupted parent-child interactions, contributing to
    **technoference**

- 📺 **Background television exposure** was linked to:

  - Lower play quality and reduced parent-child engagement

  - Higher emotional and conduct problems during lockdown, though not
    predictive post-lockdown

- 🎮 **Use of media to regulate child distress** (e.g. calming upset
  children with screens):

  - Correlated with **emotional dysregulation** and **negative affect**

  - May hinder development of **self-regulation skills**

- 📊 **Overall screen time** increased significantly during lockdowns
  but was **not a strong predictor** of post-lockdown behavior problems
  when controlling for other factors

- 🧠 **Moderating factors**:

  - Children with higher baseline behavior problems and families with
    lower income were more susceptible to negative effects of media
    exposure

  - Younger children showed greater sensitivity to contextual media use

## Screen Time for Parents and Caregivers: Parental Screen Distraction and Parenting Perceptions and Beliefs

**Alixandra Blackman**  
**Published in 2015**  
Doctoral Project submitted to Pace University

**Research Questions**

1.  Is there a relationship between the time that parents and caregivers
    spend on electronic devices and the screen time use of children?

2.  What is the frequency of parental screen time (PST) and parental
    screen distraction (PSD), and are the two associated?

3.  Are PST and PSD associated with the importance parents and
    caregivers place on parenting behaviors?

4.  Do demographic variables (e.g., income, education, age) moderate the
    relationships among PST, PSD, and parenting beliefs?

**Summary of Data Collection and Methodology**

| **Aspect**                 | **Details**                                                                                            |

**Summary of Key Findings in the Context of Parental Smartphone Use &
Child Development**

- 📱 **Parental Screen Time (PST)** was **positively correlated** with:

  - **Child screen time**

  - **Parental screen distraction (PSD)**

- 🔄 **Parental Screen Distraction (PSD)** was:

  - **Negatively correlated** with **parental responsivity** ---
    suggesting that distracted parents may be less emotionally available
    or responsive to children's needs.

- 🧠 **Parenting beliefs** (e.g., importance of bonding, discipline,
  sensitivity) were **affected by screen use**:

  - Higher PSD was linked to **lower perceived importance** of key
    parenting behaviors.

- 📊 **Moderating factors**:

  - **Education level** and **income** significantly influenced the
    relationship between PST and PSD.

  - Higher education/income was associated with **less distraction**
    despite screen use.

**Limitations Mentioned**

- **Small sample size** (n = 93) limits generalizability.

- **Self-report bias**: All data were collected via questionnaires,
  which may not reflect actual behavior.

- **Cross-sectional design**: Limits ability to infer causality.

- **Lack of observational data**: No direct measurement of parent-child
  interactions.

### Tantrums, toddlers and technology: Temperament, media emotion regulation, and problematic media use in early childhood

Sarah M. Coyne, Jane Shawcroft, Jordan T. Etherington, Megan Gale,
Hailey Holmgren, Douglas A. Gentile, Laura Stockdale  
**Published in 2021**

**Research Questions**

1.  How is **parental use of media to regulate children's emotions**
    associated with **problematic media use** in toddlers?

2.  Does **child temperament** (e.g., negative affect, surgency)
    influence the development of problematic media use?

3.  Is **emotional reactivity** to media removal linked to media emotion
    regulation and temperament?

**Summary of Data Collection and Methodology**

| **Aspect**                 | **Details**                                                                                                                         |

| **Measures Used**          | ECBQ-SF for temperament, PMUM-SF for problematic media use, custom media emotion regulation scale, video-coded emotional reactivity |

**Summary of Key Findings in the Context of Parental Smartphone Use &
Child Development**

- 📱 **Media emotion regulation** (using screens to soothe toddlers) was
  **positively associated** with:

  - **Problematic media use** in children (e.g., dependency, tantrums
    when screens are removed)

  - **Extreme emotional reactivity** when media was taken away

- 🧠 **Temperament traits**:

  - **Negative affect** and **surgency** were linked to higher media
    emotion regulation and problematic media use

  - **Effortful control** was negatively associated with media emotion
    regulation

- 🔄 **Mediation effects**:

  - Media emotion regulation **mediated** the relationship between
    temperament and problematic media use

  - Children with difficult temperaments were more likely to be soothed
    with media, which in turn predicted problematic use

- 🎬 **Observational findings**:

  - Children showed **strong emotional reactions** (e.g., tantrums,
    crying) when media was removed, especially if media was frequently
    used to regulate emotions

**🔗 Link Between Parental Media Use and Study Outcomes**

- **Parental media time** was **positively associated** with:

  - **Media emotion regulation** --- parents who spent more time using
    media were more likely to use it to soothe their toddlers.

  - This suggests that **parents who are frequent media users
    themselves** may be more inclined to rely on screens to manage their
    child's emotions.

- **Parental media time** was also **negatively associated** with:

  - **Extreme emotional reactivity** when media was removed --- possibly
    indicating that children of high-media-use parents may be more
    accustomed to screen transitions or less reactive.

**Interpretation in Context of Parental Smartphone Use & Child
Development**

This study reinforces the idea that **parental media habits** ---
including smartphone use --- are not just background noise. They
actively shape how parents manage their child's emotional states and may
contribute to the development of **problematic media use** in toddlers.
The more parents use media themselves, the more likely they are to use
it as a **regulatory tool**, which can hinder children's development of
**self-soothing and emotional regulation skills**.

**Limitations**

- **Cross-sectional design** limits causal inference

- **Self-report bias** from parents may affect accuracy

- **Sample limited to one geographic area** (Denver, CO), reducing
  generalizability

- **Short observational window** may not capture long-term emotional
  patterns

### Nod, nod, ignore: An exploratory observational study on the relation between parental mobile media use and parental responsiveness towards young children

Monika Abels, Mariek Vanden Abeele, Toke van Telgen, Helma van Meijl
(2018)

**Research Questions**

- H1a--e: When caregivers use their mobile phones, are their responses
  to children's bids for attention (a) less frequent, (b) weaker in
  strength, (c) less timely, (d) less emotionally positive, and (e) do
  children have to increase their effort to elicit a response?

- RQ1: Is there a negative linear relation between the degree of
  caregivers' absorption in phone use and their responsiveness?

- H2: Are caregivers less responsive when engaged with their phones than
  when engaged in other non--child-related activities?

- RQ2: Do caregivers who use phones in their child's presence report
  higher fear-of-missing-out (FOMO), stronger phone-checking habits, or
  more problematic phone dependency?

| Country of Study      | The Netherlands (Tilburg)                                                        |

**Data Collection Method**

- Systematic time-sampling observations (25 intervals of 10 s
  observation + 15 s coding)

- Two trained observers coding:  
  • child bids for attention (gaze, movement, auditory, touch, taking
  object)  
  • caregiver responses (occurrence, strength, timeliness,
  emotionality)  
  • non--child-related activities, with absorption levels (passive,
  occasional, exclusive)

- Post-observation questionnaire: FOMO, phone-checking habit,
  problematic phone use  
  \| Study Setting \| One public playground and two child health centers
  (routine check-ups & vaccinations) \|

**5. Key Findings in the Context of Parental Smartphone Use & Child
Development**

- Caregivers' phone engagement was associated with:  
  • Lower odds of responding at all to children's bids  
  • Weaker, more delayed, and less emotionally positive responses

- Degree of absorption mattered: exclusive phone use produced the
  strongest drop in responsiveness, exceeding the impact of other
  distractors (e.g., reading, eating).

- When phones were present, children had to use more channels (e.g.,
  waving + calling out) to secure the same level of caregiver attention.

- Caregivers who actually used their phones during observation scored
  higher on FOMO, habitual checking, and problematic phone-use scales
  than those who did not.

- Given the pivotal role of contingent responsiveness in language,
  socio-emotional and attachment development, frequent "absent presence"
  on smartphones may undermine children's early learning opportunities.

**6. Limitations**

- Small, non-random (opportunity) sample of 25 dyads limits
  generalizability.

- Short observation window (max 10 min 25 s) may not reflect habitual
  caregiver behavior.

- Participants knew they were being observed for parent--child
  interaction (possible reactivity).

- Cross-sectional, observational design precludes causal claims about
  long-term developmental impact.

- Questionnaire measures of FOMO and phone dependency rely on
  self-report and may be biased.

**Research Questions**

- Do frequency and duration of parental smartphone use in the presence
  of their child predict parents' momentary perceptions of quality time
  and child restlessness?

- Does perceived technoference (interruptions caused by smartphone use)
  mediate the link between co-present smartphone frequency and (a)
  quality time and (b) child restlessness?

- Does perceived time displacement (time with the smartphone displacing
  parent--child interactions) mediate the link between co-present
  smartphone duration and (a) quality time and (b) child restlessness?

- To what extent do these within-person associations vary across
  individual parents (heterogeneity)?

\| Analysis \| Multilevel mediation (within- and between-person) with
bootstrapped CIs; exploratory random‐slope models for heterogeneity \|

**Summary of Key Findings**

- Between-person comparisons showed no association between parents'
  average co-present smartphone frequency or duration and their
  perceptions of quality time or child restlessness.

- Within-person fluctuations:

  - Higher-than-usual smartphone **frequency** predicted greater
    perceived **technoference**.

  - Higher-than-usual smartphone **duration** predicted greater
    perceived **time displacement**.

- Perceived technoference within an hour was linked to **lower**
  parental experiences of quality time, but it did **not** predict child
  restlessness.

- Perceived time displacement unexpectedly predicted **higher**
  experiences of quality time (opposite to hypothesis) and had no effect
  on child restlessness.

- Mediation paths (frequency→technoference→quality time/restlessness;
  duration→displacement→quality time/restlessness) did not reach
  statistical significance.

- Significant between-person variability (heterogeneity) in
  within-person effects suggests these dynamics differ across individual
  parents.

**Limitations**

- Relatively small, convenience sample limited to Android users in
  Belgium, which may affect generalizability.

- Child restlessness measure (reverse-coded calmness) and
  time-displacement scale showed low variability, introducing floor
  effects.

- Reliance on self-reported ESM for perceptions; no direct observational
  data on parent--child interactions.

- Study period (14 days) may not capture longer‐term patterns or rare
  events.

- Mediation analyses may have been underpowered given the number of
  bootstrap repetitions and sample size.

- **Higher Technoference**: Leads to more **externalizing (tantrums,
  aggression)** and **withdrawal (reduced social engagement)** behaviors
  in children.

- **Parenting Stress as a Mediator**: Greater **child behavioral
  difficulties** lead to **higher parenting stress**, which subsequently
  results in **more technology interference** during parent-child
  interactions.

- **Device Use & Reduced Responsiveness**: Parents using smartphones
  more frequently during daily interactions **respond less** to their
  children\'s **emotional bids**, affecting **social-emotional
  development**.

6. Summary of Key Findings in the Context of Parental Smartphone Use &
Child Development**

- **Increased infant JA initiations**: Infants initiated JA **more
  frequently** when mothers were absorbed in phone use.

- **Reduced maternal responsiveness**: Mothers were **less likely** to
  respond to infant JA initiations when using their phones.

- **Shorter JA episodes**: Established JA episodes were **significantly
  shorter** when maternal phone use was present.

- **Lower JA success rate**: Infant attempts to engage in JA were **less
  likely to lead to successful joint attention** episodes in the mobile
  phone condition.

- **Disruptions in social communication**: Maternal phone use interfered
  with infants\' ability to practice and develop **social engagement
  skills**.

**Limitations**:

- **Limited sample diversity**: Mostly middle-to-upper-class Israeli
  families, restricting **generalizability**.

- **Short-term experimental design**: Effects of **long-term** maternal
  mobile phone use were not examined.

- **Technoference effects**:

  - **Safety risks**: Parents failed to notice **dangerous situations**
    (e.g., children engaging in risky play, wandering off).

  - **Emotional impact**: Children displayed **frustration,
    disappointment**, and in some cases, **withdrawal** from
    interactions.

- **Cross-cultural comparison**:

  - **US parents** were generally **more attentive** to children
    attempting to leave the table.

  - **Israeli parents** were **more likely** to engage with their phones
    for **longer periods**.

**7. Limitations**

- **Observational study**: Findings are based on **behavioral
