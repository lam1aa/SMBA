| Choi & Hong (2025) | 215 mothers & 73 teachers of toddlers 24-36 months; South Korea | Survey-based structural equation modeling | • Toddlers' problematic media use mediated the relationship between **maternal parenting stress** and **toddlers' socioemotional development**<br>• Maternal media use was **not directly related** to toddlers' socioemotional development |
| Coyne et al. (2021) | 269 toddlers aged 2-3 years and caregivers; US | Surveys and observational tasks | • Media emotion regulation (using screens to soothe) was associated with **problematic media use** and **extreme emotional reactivity** in children<br>• **Negative affect** and **surgency** linked to higher media emotion regulation<br>• Media emotion regulation **mediated** the relationship between temperament and problematic use |
| Gueron-Sela et al. (2023) | 313 mothers of children 2-5 years; Israel | Longitudinal online surveys (5 timepoints during COVID) | • Parental mobile device use during routines associated with **increased externalizing and internalizing behavior problems**<br>• Use of media to regulate child distress correlated with **emotional dysregulation**<br>• Children with higher baseline behavior problems were more susceptible to negative effects |
| McDaniel & Radesky (2018) | 183 couples with children 0-5 years (mean=3.0); US | 6-month longitudinal survey | • Bidirectional associations: parents stressed by difficult child behavior may **withdraw to technology**<br>• Higher technoference led to more **externalizing (tantrums, aggression)** and **withdrawal behaviors** in children<br>• Parenting stress mediated between child difficulties and parental technology use |
| McDaniel et al. (2018) | 170 families with children 1-5.5 years (mean=3.04); US | Parent-reported surveys | • Higher parental problematic technology use predicted **greater technoference**<br>• Maternal technoference associated with **higher child externalizing and internalizing behaviors**<br>• Father-child technoference did not significantly predict child behavior problems |
| Poulain et al. (2019) | 553 children aged 2-9 years and mothers; Germany | Parental questionnaires | • Children whose mothers reported **high screen time (≥5 hours/day)** were significantly more likely to have **high screen time (≥2 hours/day)**<br>• High child screen time associated with **more conduct problems** and **more hyperactivity/inattention**<br>• High maternal screen time linked to **more emotional problems** in children |
| Yang et al. (2023) | 472 parents of children 3-9 years; China | Survey-based mediation analysis | • Parental problematic smartphone use significantly correlated with **children's executive function difficulties**<br>• Technoference partially mediated this relationship<br>• Preschoolers were more affected by technoference, while older children showed stronger direct effects |
| Yu et al. (2024) | 924 mothers and preschoolers 3-6 years; China | Survey-based moderated mediation | • Maternal problematic mobile phone use **significantly predicted preschoolers' hyperactive behavior**<br>• Work-family conflict and parent-child interaction disorder acted as **chain mediators**<br>• Boys exhibited **significantly higher levels** of hyperactive behavior than girls |

(2025) | 158 parent-child dyads; children 32-79 months; China | Structural equation modeling | • Maternal smartphone addiction significantly predicted **children's social avoidance**<br>• Mother-child conflict **fully mediated** this relationship<br>• No significant effects of paternal smartphone addiction were observed |

## Table 3: Parental Factors and Moderating Variables

| Author(s) | Sample | Study Type | Main Findings |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Ali et al. (2020) | 114 mothers of infants ≤12 months; Jordan | Cross-sectional survey | • **16% of mothers** reported using smartphones for 5-14 hours per day<br>• **6.7%** identified themselves as smartphone addicts<br>• Excessive smartphone use was **negatively associated with family functioning**<br>• No significant associations with mother-infant bonding |
| Blackman (2015) | 93 parents/caregivers of children 24-36 months; US | Survey-based correlation study | • Parental screen time was **positively correlated** with child screen time and parental screen distraction<br>• Parental screen distraction **negatively correlated** with parental responsivity<br>• Education level and income significantly influenced the relationship |
| Golds et al. (2024) | 450 mothers of infants 3-9 months; UK | Cross-sectional cluster analysis | • Three clusters identified: "Infant at risk," "Mother at risk," and "Low risk"<br>• High maternal smartphone use associated with **low mother-infant responsiveness** in risk clusters<br>• Maternal mental health played a significant role in smartphone use patterns |
| Holmgren et al. (2022) | 491 mothers of infants under 1 year; US | Longitudinal surveys over 3 years | • Maternal postpartum depression at Time 1 associated with **increased parent-child dysfunctional interactions** and **higher problematic media use**<br>• Dysfunctional interactions mediated between PPD and parental depression, but **not** media use |
| Lauricella et al. (2015) | 2,326 US parents of children 0-8 years; US | Online survey | • **Parental smartphone time strongly correlated with child smartphone use**<br>• Positive parental attitudes toward mobile devices associated with **increased child use**<br>• For children under 2, correlation between parental and child smartphone use was **not statistically significant** |
| McDaniel et al. (2016) | 203 married/cohabiting mothers of children ≤3 years; US | Online survey | • **96% of mothers** reported technology interference in coparenting<br>• Smartphones were the **most frequent source of interference**<br>• Technology interference was **most common during playtime (65%)**<br>• Higher interference associated with **lower coparenting quality** |
| Schneebeli et al. (2025) | 261 parents of 14-month-old children; Switzerland | Online questionnaire | • Parenting stress **fully mediated** the association between difficult child temperament and parental problematic smartphone use<br>• Parents rating child temperament as **more difficult** reported higher parenting stress and problematic smartphone use<br>• Parental gender did not moderate these associations |

This systematic review reveals several consistent patterns across studies from different countries and methodologies:

1. **Reduced parental responsiveness**: Multiple observational studies demonstrate that parental smartphone use significantly decreases both the quantity and quality of parent-child interactions.

2. **Child behavior problems**: Higher parental smartphone use and technoference are consistently associated with increased externalizing (hyperactivity, aggression) and internalizing (withdrawal, emotional problems) behaviors in children.

3. **Bidirectional effects**: Several studies identify a cycle where difficult child behavior increases parental stress, which increases parental smartphone use, which then further affects child behavior.

4. **Age-specific impacts**: Younger children (especially infants and toddlers) show more immediate emotional reactivity to parental smartphone distraction, while older children demonstrate more behavioral and developmental effects.

5. **Cross-cultural consistency**: Despite cultural differences, similar patterns of impact were observed across studies from multiple countries (US, China, Israel, Germany, Australia, etc.), suggesting universal mechanisms.
