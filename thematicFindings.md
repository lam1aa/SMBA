# Thematic Results: Parental Smartphone Use and Child Development

## Theme 1: Disrupted Parent-Child Interactions

- Parents using smartphones show **reduced attention and responsiveness** to their children:
  - Caregivers on phones showed lower responsiveness to children's attention bids (Abels et al., 2018)
  - Mothers using phones had significantly more attention disruptions during interactions with infants (Mason et al., 2024)
  - Device-using mothers showed less verbal and nonverbal interaction during meals (Radesky et al., 2015)

- **High prevalence** of smartphone use during family time:
  - 79% of parents used mobile devices during playground visits (Lemish et al., 2019)
  - 76% of observed parents used phones during observation periods (Mangan et al., 2018)
  - 96% of mothers reported technology interference in coparenting (McDaniel et al., 2016)

- Smartphone use creates **tension and conflict** in parent-child relationships:
  - Higher smartphone frequency predicted greater tension in interactions (Denecker et al., 2023)
  - Children made more bids for attention when parents were distracted by phones (Krapf-Bar et al., 2022)

## Theme 2: Children's Immediate Responses to Parental Phone Use

- **Distress and negative emotions** when parents use phones:
  - Infants displayed increased negative affect during parental phone use (Stockdale et al., 2020)
  - Infants initiated joint attention more frequently when mothers weren't using phones (Krapf-Bar et al., 2022)

- **Attention-seeking behaviors** increase:
  - Children used more attention-getting strategies when parents were on phones (Lemish et al., 2019)
  - Device use during routines associated with increased behavior problems (Gueron-Sela et al., 2023)

## Theme 3: Long-term Effects on Child Development

- **Behavioral problems** linked to parental phone use:
  - Maternal problematic phone use predicted preschoolers' hyperactive behavior (Yu et al., 2024)
  - Higher technoference associated with more child behavior issues (McDaniel et al., 2018)

- **Social-emotional development** impacts:
  - Maternal smartphone addiction predicted children's social avoidance (Zhu et al., 2025)
  - Parental device use linked to more emotional problems in children (McDaniel et al., 2018)

- **Cognitive development** effects:
  - Parental smartphone use correlated with poorer executive function in children (Yang et al., 2023)
  - Maternal phubbing related to behavior problems, mediated by toddlers' media use (Choi & Hong, 2025)

## Theme 4: Bidirectional Effects and Cycle

- **Stress and smartphone use** form a cycle:
  - Parents stressed by difficult child behavior may withdraw into device use (McDaniel & Radesky, 2018)
  - Parenting stress mediated the link between child temperament and problematic smartphone use (Schneebeli et al., 2025)
  - Maternal depression associated with increased parent-child dysfunction and problematic phone use (Holmgren et al., 2022)

## Theme 5: Children Mirroring Parents' Media Habits

- **Strong correlation** between parent and child screen time:
  - Parental smartphone time strongly correlated with child smartphone use (Lauricella et al., 2015)
  - Children whose mothers had high screen time (â‰¥5 hours/day) showed significantly more screen time themselves (Poulain et al., 2019)
  - Parental screen time positively correlated with child screen time (Blackman, 2015)

- **Media use for emotional regulation**:
  - Parents using screens to soothe children associated with problematic media use in those children (Coyne et al., 2021)
  - Distinct risk patterns identified based on maternal smartphone use and child outcomes (Golds et al., 2024)

## Theme 6: Cross-Cultural Consistency of Findings

- Similar patterns observed across multiple countries:
  - United States (Radesky et al., 2015; McDaniel et al., 2018; Coyne et al., 2021)
  - China (Yang et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025)
  - Israel (Krapf-Bar et al., 2022; Gueron-Sela et al., 2023)
  - Europe (Abels et al., 2018; Denecker et al., 2023; Poulain et al., 2019)
  - Australia (Mangan et al., 2018)
  - Jordan (Ali et al., 2020)
  - South Korea (Choi & Hong, 2025)
